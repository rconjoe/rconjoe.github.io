I'm a 29 year old Web and Systems developer from Long Beach, CA.

My main project right now is <a href="https://alpha.provana.gg">Provana.GG</a>, an ecommerce platform where content creators can sell their time. I wrote the entire backend and all of our developer tooling, as well as managing the project, architecture design, and CI for the whole platform. I've written more about this app and the amazing, small-but-mighty team building it on my <a href="Teams.html">Teams</a> page.

I think it's important to contribute to open-source projects, both from an ethical standpoint and because of the value it brings to a developer in learning new skills, processes, and ways of working with people. As such, I do my best to donate as much free time as I can to <a href="https://linuxgsm.com">Linux GSM</a>, a set of bash scripts used to make scaffolding mutiplayer gameservers accessible to anyone. It's a great FOSS project built around a community of really talented people from all over the world, who have in common a love for online gaming (and the systems
underneath it).
